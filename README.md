# Sentiment Analysis on Food Reviews
The aim of this project is to apply the knowledge acquired during the "Data Analytics" course.

We performed a sentiment analysis on the Food Reviews dataset `food.tsv`.

You can find all the code in `Sentiment_Analysis_on_Food_Reviews.ipynb`.

We have created a new `new_food.csv` dataset with other relevant information that can help other people in case they want to extract more information.

If you want a detailed report of the work done you can read `Data_Analytics.pdf`, if you want to see the presentation done you can see `Food Delivery App.pptx`. Attention: both documents are written in Italian!

We have also created a small dashboard in python to be able to make the data a little more accessible. See `little_dashboard.py`
